nsaphx is a Python package that provides a flexible and extensible framework for defining and applying computational instructions to data while ensuring efficient computation and storage through the use of a directed acyclic graph and database storage. nsaphx's instruction handlers can be easily extended by defining new classes and methods, which can then be used to create new instructions that can be applied to data. Each object is computed only once and stored in the database, ensuring that computation is efficient and data is not duplicated.
