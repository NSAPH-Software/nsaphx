Scientific research management involves tracking interim results, adjusting the sequence of steps, and building upon the work of other researchers in the lab. Efficient navigation through the research process, including the ability to go back and forth among results, is crucial for reproducing results and discovering new insights. However, manually managing these steps requires selecting a directory for storing interim results, naming files, and documenting all steps, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Even when researchers try to document their steps, they may forget to update certain parameters or steps, which can compromise the entire process. Another drawback of manual processes is storing the same data in multiple places and computing the same process several times because the data is duplicated in different steps, or researchers forget that they have already computed it. The nsaphx package is designed and implemented to facilitate scientific research management, allowing researchers to focus on actual research rather than administrative tasks. The package is specifically designed for applications in National Studies on Air Pollution and Health.
